# Commentator and Moderator
 
At least once during the semester, you will be assigned to serve as a Commentator as well as a Moderator. Each gives you the opportunity to practice skills transferable to your other courses, as well as in the undergraduate- and graduate-level classroom when you enter the profession. Specifically, you will practice organizing creative yet concise oral presentation, managing classroom dynamics, and developing questions that foment lively discussion.  
 
*Commentator:* The Commentator prepares a presentation for the entire group that is not more than 5-7 minutes long in which they critically and generously engage with the essays and establishes links with the readings and/or general topics of the course. There is no need to summarize the readings as the whole class will have read the essays for the session. Commentators begin the constructive discussion or conversation about the readings. They should also arrive with 2-4 printed questions (a handout for each member of the class) that can guide additional conversations in small groups. For example, the questions can be directed specifically to a reading or to a section that was interesting/compelling/scandalous, etc. Or they could ask how the readings relate to other previous readings, individual projects, and so on.  
 
*Moderator:* The Moderator keeps the discussion fair and orderly. They make sure that a few people do not dominate the session and that the commentators stay within their time limits. They keep a queue of people who want to speak, and, if someone has not spoken in a session and wants to, moves them to the front of the line. And, of course, they read the essays to boost the discussion as needed.  
 
*Comentarista:* Esta persona prepara una presentación de no más de 5-7 minutos en la que comenta críticamente y generosamente sobre los puntos más importantes del ensayo y lo vincula con las lecturas y/o los temas generales del curso.  No hay que resumir los ensayos porque todos ya los deben de haber leído. Los comentaristas inician la conversación y discusión constructiva de las lecturas. Esta persona también llega a la sesión con 2-4 preguntas (impresas, una hoja para cada miembro de la clase) para guiar la conversación en grupos pequeños. Por ejemplo, pueden ser dirigidas específicamente a una lectura o un fragmento que le llama la atención o pueden buscar hacer vínculos entre otras lecturas previas, proyectos individuales, etc.  
 
*Moderador:*  Esta persona mantiene la discusión y el orden durante la sesión. Se asegura de que ningún participante domine la sesión, y que los presentadores y comentaristas se ciñan al tiempo que se les ha asignado. Mantiene una lista de todos los que quieren hablar y si alguien que no ha hablado quiere intervenir, lo mueve al principio de la lista. Y por supuesto lee todos los ensayos para animar la discusión de ser necesario.

# Key Concept Reports

Key Concept resources offer novices a place to start with unfamiliar or complex topics. They generally consist of definitions, controversies, seminal thinkers, and so on. [Take a look at Dictionary of Critical Theory or Diccionario de estudios culturales for examples].

At the end of each unit (due dates below), you will produce a 500-word entry that can serve as an introduction to a concept, topic, theory, or argument of your choosing drawn from the readings and discussions of the unit. You may consult outside readings as well to flesh out the entry as well.  Consider your audience to be an advanced undergraduate population. This is an opportunity for you to practice synthesizing the works of others, a skill you will employ throughout your career, and to be as clear and concise as possible taking into consideration the 500-word limit. 

Key Concept #1 due: September 27  

Key Concept #2 due: October 25  

Key Concept #3 due: November 29  

Key Concepts are graded complete or incomplete, and will be revised based on professor feedback. Both the original and revised versions will be due on the final day of class, and will include a brief memo explaining the changes/improvements you made.

Students from the Department of Spanish and Portuguese should write their Key Concepts in either Spanish or Portuguese.

# Digital Collection Review
Over the course of the semester, each student will write one 750-900 word review of a digital archive or collection of their choice. For the purposes of this assignment, any coherent set of digital objects that has been put online by a library or archive and that has some relevance to the fields of Latin American, colonial, or Indigenous studies would be appropriate. You may choose any collection, including those featured on the resources tab of the course website. The review will be posted on the course website for a public audience, and should adhere to the following guidelines (derived from the American Archivist Reviews Online):
Briefly describe the material, providing a simple overview and summary.  Who created it and what does it contain?
Discuss the resource within an archival context, its relationship to archives and its significance for the discipline. This should include reference to at least one class reading.  
Evaluate the resource as a whole in terms of its usefulness to archivists and users of archives materials. This should include not just the content of the collection, but also its interface and metadata.  
Do not focus on minor typographical or factual errors unless the work is significantly compromised.

*Submission guidelines*
Follow the “Making a Blog Post” instructions on the course website to upload your article.

# Unit 1: Indigenous Holdings Survey Prototype
A lib-guide is a resource, usually online, that helps researchers investigate a subject or theme. One way to think of it is as an interactive annotated bibliography that allows users to understand the kinds of resources that are available, understand how they are organized and where they are located, and identify the resources that are most useful to them.

For this group assignment, the class will collectively develop a prototype of a lib-guide for indigenous materials in the Benson Latin American Collection. The assignment is motivated by the SAA Protocols for Native American Archival Materials, which call on heritage institutions to be more intentional in their approach to indigenous heritage and intellectual property. One step in this process is identifying the breadth and depth of indigenous holdings in a collection. 

The Benson holdings are too large to be completely surveyed for this assignment. That’s why this assignment asks you to create a prototype - a model for what this kind of lib-guide should be. This will involve making decisions as a class about the lib-guide, including:
* Scope: You are required to include at least some colonial-era holdings in your survey, but beyond that, the scope of the survey is up to you. What portion of the collection do you want to survey? How will you define an indigenous holding? What communities, collections, or kinds of material do you want to prioritize?
* Method: what method will you use to find and identify relevant information?
* Audience: Who is the lib-guide intended for? 
* Content: What kind of information should the lib-guide contain? 
* Form: How should the information be presented? How should it be organized?
* Process: How will the labor of this assignment be distributed?
* Platform: How do you want to present your lib-guide? Do you want it to be public? How do you want to disseminate it?
* Evaluation: How should the completion of this assignment be evaluated by the instructors?

These decisions will be discussed during class, but you may have to continue the discussion outside of class as well. In addition to some scheduled discussion time, you will have a full class period to work collectively prior to the submission date.

# Unit 2: Humanities Media Project Proposal 
The digital portal to the Archivo Histórico de la Policía Nacional of Guatemala was launched in 2011 as a way to provide public access to the records contained in the AHPN. At the beginning of this unit, we will do an in-class exercise to explore this digital collection and evaluate the interface in terms of access, accessibility, and discoverability. 

LLILAS Benson is remaking the AHPN website in order to improve access to the collection. This creates an opportunity for us to think creatively about what other kinds of features — in addition to better access — might help make this digital collection more meaningful and useful for the multiple audiences affiliated with the archive. 

In this individual assignment, you are asked to write a grant proposal for a multimedia project that would create new paths to engaging with this collection. This could be a crowdsourced metadata project; an art project; a series of videos; or another project of your choice. The outcome of the project should be supplemental to the AHPN web portal in some way. 

Your proposal should follow the guidelines for the [Humanities Media Project](https://humanitiesmediaproject.org/call-for-proposals/) and should include:
* A 2-3 page project description and justification (up to 1500 words)
* An itemized budget of up to $5,000.
* A list of examples of any similar projects that have been undertaken
* An up-to-date CV. (Please follow this format; talk to us if you have a strong preference for something different.)

The assignment should be submitted as a single word document or PDF via Canvas.
